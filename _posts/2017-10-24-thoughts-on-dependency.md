title: Thoughts on dependency
---

##### relations
- local relations: selection
- long distance relations: displacement

##### alphabets
- trees
- strings
- string yield of trees

##### real-life cases
- a licenser could be unboundedly far away from the licensee __solvable with tiers__
- blocker = adding an optional extra element could change dependency relation __solvable by point to the uniqueness of the subject-matter__
    + *john drinks lukewarm coffee anymore
    + john hardly drinks lukewarm coffee anymore

##### lessons
- where to tweak
    + alphabet
        * eg
    + relation
        * from local to ps to tier
    + the subject matter
        * always start with concrete cases
