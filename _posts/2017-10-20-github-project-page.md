A designated [blog](https://leiliu1.github.io/blog/) page was added to the main github page. Things are really difficult when they don't work, and are really straight forward when they do. 

##### What I wanted was
- a sub-site that is not directly revealed in the main page
- a different theme
- to be able to manage with the same github account

##### What I got was
- github page [project](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) page
- a nice and neat [theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
- being able to manage with the same github account

##### resources and tips
- a step-by-step [guide](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/) that finally gets things to work
- copying a md file from the main site (running with [this](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)) doesn't seem to work for the blog branch (running with [this](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes))
- an alternative would be to use ssh to manage two accounts, too hard for me to get to work
